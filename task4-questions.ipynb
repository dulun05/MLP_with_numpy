    "What is the effect of increasing the number of layers in an MLP? Are larger (with a greater number of hidden layers) models preferred to smaller ones? If so, why? Or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your answer: **[Effect: the model will have more capacity to learn the in-sample data better. But larger models are not preferred to smaller ones because we always want simple models. Larger models might be overfitted.]**"
