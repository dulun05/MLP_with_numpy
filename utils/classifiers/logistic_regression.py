def logistic_regression_loss_naive(w, X, y, reg):
    """
    Logistic regression loss function, naive implementation (with loops over N samples)

    NOTE:
    In this function, you are NOT supposed to use functions like:
    - np.dot
    - np.matmul (or operator @)
    - np.linalg.norm
    You can (not necessarily) use functions like:
    - np.sum
    - np.log
    - np.exp

    Use this linear classification method to find optimal decision boundary.

    Inputs have dimension D, there are K classes, and we operate on minibatches
    of N examples.

    Inputs:
    - w: (float) a numpy array of shape (D + 1,) containing weights.
    - X: (float) a numpy array of shape (N, D + 1) containing a minibatch of data.
    - y: (uint8) a numpy array of shape (N,) containing training labels; y[i] = k means 
        that X[i] has label k, where k can be either 0 or 1.
    - reg: (float) regularization strength. For regularization, we use L2 norm.

    Returns a tuple of:
    - loss: (float) the mean value of loss functions over N examples in minibatch.
    - gradient: (float) gradient wrt W, an array of same shape as W
